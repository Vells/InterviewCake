Problem #30

Write an efficient function that checks whether
any permutation of an input string is a palindrome.

For a string of length n, there are n! permutations
(n choices for the first character, times nâˆ’1 choices for the second character, etc).
Checking each length-n permutation to see if it's a palindrome involves
checking each character, taking O(n) time. That gives us O(n!n)
